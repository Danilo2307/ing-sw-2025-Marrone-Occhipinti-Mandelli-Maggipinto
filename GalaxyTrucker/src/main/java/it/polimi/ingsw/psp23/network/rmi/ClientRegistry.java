/**
 * The ClientRegistry class is a remote implementation for managing the registry of clients
 * and players in a distributed system using RMI. It maintains mappings between client connection
 * names, callbacks, and usernames. This provides functionalities to register, unregister,
 * and retrieve client or player details.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Maintains a map of registered clients' callback references.
 * - Tracks players and their associated connections.
 * - Provides operations to add, remove, or retrieve client information.
 * - Supports bidirectional search for usernames and connections.
 *
 * This class extends {@link UnicastRemoteObject} to enable remote invocation and implements
 * the {@link ClientRegistryInterface} to define registry-related operations.
